## About the project

This is a project I finished in 2019.   
It is a memory game designed and implemented various data structure using C.  
<https://github.com/hcy1219/C_Project_Concentration_cardgame>  

這也是經過一個學期的課程後完成的Project，主要就是在練習C語言，製作一個記憶翻牌遊戲。  
在這個學期之後又上了一個學期的Data Stucture，所以對我來說C語言應該是目前最熟練的語言了吧。
